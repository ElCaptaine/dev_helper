## Components

### DatabaseHandler

The `DatabaseHandler` is a crucial component of `pj_dev_helpers`, designed to streamline database-related tasks. 
It simplifies database connections, session management, and query execution. 
For detailed information on how to use the `DatabaseHandler`,
refer to the [documentation](documentation/database_handler.md).

```python
from pj_dev_helpers import DatabaseHandler

# Example usage
db_handler = DatabaseHandler(config_file=".db.conf", section="test_database")
with db_handler as session:
    results = session.execute_query("SELECT * FROM your_table")
    print(results)
```

## Testing locally

If you want to test locally, please make sure that Docker is installed, and ensure that the .db.conf file has an entry liketest_pj_helper_database.

Also, make sure that the PostgreSQL container is set up and running. For example:

```bash
docker run --name postgres-container \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=test_user \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=test_password \
  -p 5432:5432 \
